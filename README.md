# Greenfield Template

This is a template that I use for new projects. It already has some basic
stuff setup, such as:

* Retrofit + OKHttp
* EventBus
* Dagger
* MVP stuff
* Butterknife

I'm planning to add basic testing functionality (both unit tests and Instrumented
tests). Stay tuned.

PS: The Retrofit + EventBus architecture showcased here has served me well
in a few projects.
