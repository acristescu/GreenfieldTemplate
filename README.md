# Greenfield Template (WIP)

[![BuddyBuild](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/api/statusImage?appID=595a5011982d060001a36b8a&branch=master&build=latest)](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/apps/595a5011982d060001a36b8a/build/latest?branch=master)

This is a template that I use for new projects. It already has some basic
stuff setup, such as:

* Retrofit + OKHttp
* Otto
* Dagger
* MVP stuff
* Butterknife

I'm planning to add basic testing functionality (both unit tests and Instrumented
tests). Stay tuned.

PS: The Retrofit + Otto architecture showcased here has served me well
in a few projects.
