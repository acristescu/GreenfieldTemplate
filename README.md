# Greenfield Template (RxJava 2 version)

[![BuddyBuild](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/api/statusImage?appID=595a5011982d060001a36b8a&branch=master&build=latest)](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/apps/595a5011982d060001a36b8a/build/latest?branch=master)

This is a template that I use for new projects. It already has some basic
stuff setup, such as:

* Retrofit + OKHttp
* RxJava
* Dagger
* MVP stuff
* Butterknife
* Local JUnit tests
* UI tests

This is a (more recent and less battle-tested) variation of the architecture decribed in
 my [blog post](http://zenandroid.io/testable-and-robust-architecture-for-android-projects/).
 The main difference here is the use of RxJava 2 instead of the event bus to bring back results
 from the service into the presenter. This does simplify a lot of the piping, particularly in
 the error handling part.

## Overview

Here is the diagram of the architecture proposed here:

The flow of events and data:

1. The __Activity__ reacts to the user input by informing the __Presenter__ that data is required.
1. The __Presenter__ fires off the appropriate request in the service layer (and instructs the __Activity__ to display a busy indicator).
1. The __Service__ then issues the correct REST call to the __Retrofit__ layer.
1. The __Retrofit__ layer exchanges HTTP requests and responses with the Server and returns an `Observable` (or perhaps `Single`).
1. The __Service__ possibly inspects the `Observable`, schedules it on the correct thread (in order to keep the __Presenter__ free of Android Schedulers and thus pure JUnit testable) and returns it back to the __Presenter__.
1. The __Presenter__ receives the `Observable`, retrieves the data or error and issues the correct commands to the __Activity__ to update the UI (and dismiss the busy indicator).
1. The __Activity__ presents the user with the data or error message.
